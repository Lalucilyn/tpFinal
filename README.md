E-Commerce app made with ReactJs for the client-side and NodeJs and Express for the Server side. 

A couple of notes about this project:
- This project was made as an exercise for ADA-ITW coding bootcamp.
- It was tested in Chrome and Firefox.
- The specs of the exercise specified that, since the thumbnails came from the api in a very low resolution, it was expected for them to look a little pixelated in the final result.
